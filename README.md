## Daniel Paulino

Hi! I'm Daniel 🙋🏽‍♂️. By day I'm a software engineer, and by night I build apps for Windows 10 🙌🏽. Here's a gist about me:

* 📚 I taught myself .NET, C#, and XAML
* 🧬 [I built a tool that closes gaps in the human genome](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss/tree/master/Sealer)
* 🐦 [I built the best REST client on the Microsoft Store](https://github.com/jenius-apps/nightingale-rest-api-client)
* 💊 [I built one of the top medication tracking apps for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/pillbox/9nblggh4x7vb)
* 😅 I was once banned on Twitter for 4 hours because I exceeded the maximum tweeting rate
